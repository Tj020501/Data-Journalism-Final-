# Journ 124 Final Project: Data Analysis and Visualization of United States Gun Violence 
## By Timothy Henry
### Data Analysis Process
* Download the "Gun Violence" datasheet as a .cvs file, upload it to google drive, and open it with google sheets  

The following are five questions and step-by-step answers based on the data sets:


__Question 1: Which cities had the largest and least amount of murders since 2014, and how many did they average each year?__

__Step-by-step answer:__

1. Insert a pivot table from the data sheet so that we may compare all the cities report killings together. 
2. When the Pivot Table is open, insert the category "City or County" into the rows column so that all the cities may be listed. 
3. Next put the category "N_killed" into the values section of your pivot table. (Be sure that the values for N_killed are summarized by the sum)
4. Referring back to the rows sections that contains the cities, change the sorting to "Sort by N_killed"
5. When the order is in Ascending, the data will reflect the cities with the least amount of murders to the cities with the most.

* __Answer: As seen in the pivot table, there are several cities listied where no murders occured, however there were still reports of gun violence which is why they are listed on the data sheet. Cities such as Abbottstown,Abercrombie,Accident, and Achille had no murders from gun violence since 2014. These cities may have had people injured rather than killed.__
6. Next Change the order to descending to see which cities had the most amount of murders due to gun violence.
